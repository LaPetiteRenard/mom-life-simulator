# Mom Life Simulator

This is a fun Python mini-game simulating the emotional rollercoaster of parenting toddlers.

## Versions
- `mom_life_simulator.py` – the original version
- `mom_life_simulator_sanity_mode.py` – now with a sanity meter because you're insane and can't tell how much

## How to Use
Run the `.py` file in a Python environment and answer the prompts.

Press `q` to quit before losing your last shred of sanity and probably dignity.

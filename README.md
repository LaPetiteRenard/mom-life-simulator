# Mom Life Simulator: Sanity Mode

> **Python** · **Beginner Project** · **Text-Based Game** · **Humor** · **Parenting Simulation**

A humorous, text-based simulation of a day in the life of a mom with toddlers — now with a **Sanity Meter**! Built as a beginner-friendly Python project using loops, functions, and conditionals... plus soul-deep sarcasm.

## Features

- **Time-based gameplay**: Navigate morning chaos, afternoon meltdowns, and evening negotiations
- **Sanity tracking**: Watch your sanity meter drop from 5 (functioning adult) to 0 (human bouncy castle)
- **Painfully relatable dialogue**: Every choice feels like your real life
- **Beginner-friendly code**: Clean Python structure perfect for learning

## How to Play
